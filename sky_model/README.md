# Sky model

This folder contains the generated sky model.

There will be two models:

- GPS = Galactic plane survey
- EGS = Extra-galactic survey

## GPS sky model

- The bright sources are from gamma-cat.
  Very much work in progress.
- `snrs_cristofari.ecsv` is a first version of an SNR source population
  by Pierre Cristofari (2017-01-20).
  New version discussed via email and coming soon.

## EGS sky model

- No idea yet who makes it or what it looks like.
