About SNRs_SIMULATED_TEST.ecsv
***********************************************

SNRs_SIMULATED_TEST.ecsv presents results of simulations of the gamma—ray emission from Galactic SNRs, in the TeV and multi—TeV range. 

Using Monte Carlo simulations, we simulate the location and time of four types of supernovae in the Galaxy. Knowing their age and location, the evolution of the associated SNR is calculated. A model for the acceleration of particles at the SNR shock is used to estimate the gamma—ray emission from each SNR. 
A description of the basis of this model is presented in: Cristofari, P., Gabici, S., Casanova, S., Terrier, R., Parizot, E. 2013, MNRAS, 434, 2748
