# IRF - Instrument response functions

This folder contains the CTA instrument response functions
(one of the inputs to the CTA-DC)

For now, the scripts and files are super preliminary.

The prod2 IRF root files come from Gernot Maier and Abelardo Moralejo. These
point-like IRFs have been used to produce the public ones.
No smoothing is applied on it.
